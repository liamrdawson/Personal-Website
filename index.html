            <p>I love CSS, and I can use it to build modern, resoponsive, mobile-first designs for users across all types of browsers on the web.I make use of the most modern CSS3 technologies where possible for a high quality and sleek user experience.

            Most of my projects are built with SASS. This allows me to build scalable, flexible and well maintained web projects.

            I'm very comfortable with using Bootstrap 3 and 4, which I use when I need to build a solid and reliable layout quickly. When building a quick mockup ahead of a project, I will often reach for Bootstrap as a tool for getting up going.

          </div>
          <div class="card__expander">
            I love JavaScript and use it as much as possible to “make web pages alive” and to build intuitive, interactive and dynamic web interfaces. There are an abundance of web frameworks available and I've prioritised mastering the use of "vanilla" JavaScript as a foundation for learning other technologies.

          <div class="card__expander">
            Most of my original learning has been through trawling GitHub for inspiring projects and code snippets to implement. Today I use Github to manage all of my ongoing projects. I've found using a distributed version control system such as Git to be an empowering tool which has allowed me to safely track my progress and experiment with new ideas in secure environments.

            I can use JQuery to build fast and feature rich websites such as the one you're on now. My foundation in pure JavaScript has allowed me to get the most out of the JQuery library, it's ability to manipulate the DOM and event handling, while still understanding what's actually going on "under the hood".
